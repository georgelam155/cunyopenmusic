### 1.1 Notes

In musical notation, a note indicates a pitch and rhythmic value. A note consists of a *notehead* (either empty or filled in), and optionally can include a *stem*, *beam*, *dot*, or *flag*.

### 1.2 Staff

Notes alone can't convey their pitch information without being placed on a staff. A *staff* consists of five horizontal lines, evenly spaced. The plural of staff is *staves*.

### 1.3 Clefs

Notes *still* can't convey their pitch information if the staff doesn't include a clef. A clef indicates which pitches are assigned to the lines and spaces on a staff. The two most commonly used clefs are the *treble* and *bass* clef; others that you'll see relatively frequently are *alto* and *tenor* clef. 

Here is the pitch C4 (also known as "Middle C") placed on the treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs.

[Take a look at this exercise.](https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note/b8tyryyynybyyy) How are the letter names of each note arranged on the treble clef? Which letters of the alphabet are used?

[Now take a look at this exercise, which uses the bass clef.](https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note/n8tyryyynybyyy) How are the letter names arranged?

[Finally, take a look at this exercise, which removes the "helpers".](https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note/d8t8tyryyynyyyyy) Can you correctly name the notes?

### 1.4 Grand staff

The grand staff consists of two staves, one that uses a treble clef, and one that uses a bass clef. The staves are connected by a curly brace. Grand staves are used frequently for notating piano music and other polyphonic instruments. 

### 1.5 Ledger lines

When the music's range exceeds what can be written on the staff, extra lines are drawn so that we can still clearly read the pitch. These extra lines are called *ledger lines.* In the example below, From Haydn's Piano Sonata in G (Hob. XVI: 39), Ab5 occurs just above the treble staff in the right hand, and G3 and B3 occur just below the treble staff in the left hand.
