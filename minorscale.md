## Standard 3: The Minor Scale

### 3.1 The Natural Minor Scale / Aeolian Mode

Remember how we derived the major scale? It consisted of two identical tetrachords (W-W-H) connected together by an additional **W**hole step.

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the **minor scale**. There are several different types of minor scales, but all of them include a special characteristic: the third note of the scale, when compared to the major scale, sounds a bit lower.

Here's the C major scale:

And here's the c minor scale:


There are several scales that one might describe as minor, all of which have a characteristic third scale degree that is lower than the one found in the major scale. The minor scale most frequently used in tonal music from the Common Practice period is based on the aeolian mode (you’ll read more about modes later), which is sometimes referred to as the natural minor scale.

The natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Note the changes in solfège syllables.
