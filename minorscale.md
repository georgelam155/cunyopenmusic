## Standard 3: The Minor Scale

### 3.1 The Natural Minor Scale / Aeolian Mode

Remember how we derived the major scale? It consisted of two identical tetrachords (W-W-H) connected together by an additional **W**hole step.

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the **minor scale**. There are several different types of minor scales, but all of them include a special characteristic: the third note of the scale, when compared to the major scale, sounds a bit lower.

Here's the C major scale:

And here's the c minor scale:

The above minor scale is the most frequently used form of the minor scale from the Common Practice period, and is also known as the *aeolian mode* or the *natural minor scale*. We will refer to this scale with either of these names.

### 3.2 The Minor 3rd

Before we look at scales, let's add one more interval to our discussion. Recall that we have already talked about the *minor 2nd* (one half step) and the *major 2nd* (two half steps). To help us find the notes of the minor scale, we'll also need to know how to find a *minor 3rd*. To find a minor 3rd above a given note:
1. Start with the given note on the piano keyboard, and write down the note name (e.g. C).
2. Using the musical alphabet, write down the letter name that is a third above the original note, counting the original as "1". (e.g. C - D - E)
3. Go to the piano keyboard. Find the original note, and raise the pitch by three half steps.
3. Describe this new pitch by using the letter name that is a third above the original note, using accidentals as necessary (e.g. E-flat).

### 3.3 Relative Major, Relative Minor

Before we look at the interval pattern for a natural minor scale, take a look at the key signature for the c minor scale above. It consists of 3 flats, and is indeed the key signature for E-flat major. Since both C minor and E-flat major share the same key signature, they are "relatives" of each other:
- c minor is the **relative minor** of E-flat major
- E-flat major is the **relative major** of c minor

Hence, if we can figure out how to derive the relative minor of a given major key, we can then easily find the notes of that minor scale. To find the relative minor of a given major key, follow these steps.
1. Note the *tonic* of the major key. (In this case, it's E-flat).
2. Write out the notes of the major scale.
3. Find the 6th scale degree (e.g. the 6th note) of this scale. (In this case, it's C). This is the *tonic* of the relative minor of this scale.

But what if we want to find the notes of a minor scale? We'll first need to find its **relative major**. To do this:
1. Note the *tonic* of the minor scale that you would like to write.
2. Find the **minor 3rd** above.
3. This is the *relative major* of this scale.

By following the steps above, you'll see that the the natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W - H - W - W - H - W - W.
