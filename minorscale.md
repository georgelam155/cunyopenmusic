## Standard 3: The Minor Scale

### 3.1 The Natural Minor Scale / Aeolian Mode

Remember how we derived the major scale? It consisted of two identical tetrachords (W-W-H) connected together by an additional **W**hole step.

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the **minor scale**. There are several different types of minor scales, but all of them include a special characteristic: the third note of the scale, when compared to the major scale, sounds a bit lower. 

Here's the C major scale: (Press the "play" button on the upper-left hand corner to hear what it sounds like.)

And here's the c minor scale:

The above minor scale is the most frequently used form of the minor scale from the Common Practice period, and is also known as the *aeolian mode* or the *natural minor scale*. We will refer to this scale with either of these names.

### 3.2 The Minor 3rd

Before we look at scales, let's add one more interval to our discussion. Recall that we have already talked about the *minor 2nd* (one half step) and the *major 2nd* (two half steps). To help us find the notes of the minor scale, we'll also need to know how to find a *minor 3rd*. To find a minor 3rd above a given note:
1. Start with the given note on the piano keyboard, and write down the note name (e.g. C).
2. Using the musical alphabet, write down the letter name that is a third above the original note, counting the original as "1". (e.g. C - D - E)
3. Go to the piano keyboard. Find the original note, and raise the pitch by three half steps.
3. Describe this new pitch by using the letter name that is a third above the original note, using accidentals as necessary (e.g. E-flat).

### 3.3 Relative Major, Relative Minor

Take a look at the key signature for the c minor scale above. It consists of 3 flats, and you'll notice that it is also the key signature for E-flat major. Since both C minor and E-flat major share the same key signature, they both use the same notes. We call these two scales "relatives" of each other:
- c minor is the **relative minor** of E-flat major
- E-flat major is the **relative major** of c minor


What is the relationship between these relatives? Notice that the tonic of a natural minor scale will always be a **minor 3rd** below the tonic of its relative major. We can use this information to find the notes of a minor scale by first finding its relative major. To do this:

1. Write down the *tonic* of the minor scale that you would like to write. (e.g. "C" if you're looking the notes for c minor.)
2. Find the **minor 3rd** above this note. This is the tonic of the **relative major**. (e.g. E-flat)
3. Write out the notes of this major scale (e.g. E-flat) by using the interval pattern W-W-H-W-W-W-H. <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/8728f0a032" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
4. Re-write the notes of the scale by starting with the 6th scale degree (C) and ending with the 5th (also C). You have just written a natural minor scale! <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/9a3f182099" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


By following the steps above, you'll see that the the natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W - H - W - W - H - W - W.
