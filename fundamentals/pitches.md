## 2.1 Half Steps and Whole Steps ##

### 2.11 The Keyboard ###

The keyboard is great for helping you develop a visual, aural, and tactile understanding of music theory. On the illustration below, the *pitch-class* letter names are written on the keyboard.

### 2.12 Half Steps and Whole Steps

One of the reasons why we use the keyboard is to help you visualize how pitches are organized on the *chromatic scale*, a series of pitches arranged by ascending or descending half steps.

#### What's a half step?
A half step describes the distance between a key and the *next adjacent key* on the piano. For example, the distance between a white key and its next adjacent black key is a half step. However, there are two pairs of white keys on the piano that have no black keys in between them (E and F, B and C). Since they describe two adjacent keys, these are examples of half steps as well.

#### What's a whole step?
A whole step is equivalent to two half steps. For example, the distance between C and D is a whole step because it includes two half steps (C to C#, C# to D).

### 2.13 Accidentals

Accidentals are used to indicate when a pitch has been raised or lowered by one or two half steps. When described as as words, they are written *after* the note name (e.g. "C-sharp"). When they are placed next to a note on a staff, they are written *before* the note.

#### Lowering Pitches
- When you lower one of the white notes of the piano by a half step, you add a flat. 
- When you lower a note that is already flat by a half step, you add a double flat. 
- When you lower a note that is already sharp by a half step, you add a natural.

#### Raising Pitches
- When you raise one of the white notes of the piano by a half step, you add a sharp.
- When you raise a note that is already sharp by a half step, you add a double sharp.
- When you raise a note that is already flat by a half step, you add a natural.

The example below shows the symbols for flat, natural, sharp, double sharp, and double flat, respectively.

### 2.14 Enharmonic Equivalence ###

Notice that some of the piano keys have two names (see the illustration below). When two note names share a key on the keyboard, they are said to have *enharmonic equivalence*. Theoretically, each piano key could have several names (the note C could also be considered D&#9837;&#9837;, for instance), but it's usually not necessary to know more than two enharmonic spellings.
