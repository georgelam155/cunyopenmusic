## 2.3 Key Signatures

### 2.31 What is a key signature?

When you're writing a piece of music that uses a specific **major scale** for an extended period of time, it gets tedious to write out the same accidentals over and over again. 

For example, here is a simple melody in D major, written without a key signature.

To avoid adding so many accidentals to the notation, composers use a **key signature** at the beginning of each staff to remind performers to always use flats or sharps for certain pitches in the major scale. A **key signature** is a collection of every accidental found in a scale.

In this case, since this piece is written using the D major scale (e.g. it's in the "key" of D major), *all* F's and C's will always be played as F#'s and C#'s. Hence, instead of writing a # next to all F's and C's, we can use a key signature at the beginning of the staff to remind the performer that F and C will always be played as F-sharp and C-sharp, regardless of octave.

### 2.32 Reading Key Signatures

What do key signatures look like? Here is an example of seven different key signatures, all using sharps, and all on the treble clef.

When you see a key signature in notated music, it will always be placed at the beginning of each line of staff (also known as a "system"). The key signature is always placed directly to the right of the clef.

Here is an easy way to identify the major key of a piece of music by just looking at the key signature:

* For **sharp** key signatures, take a look at the final sharp in the signature. When you raise the pitch one half-step above the pitch indicated by the final sharp, you will arrive at the major key associated with this signature.

* For **flat** key signatures, take a look at the second-to-last flat, which indicates the major key associated with this signature. If there is only one flat, you'll need to remember that this is the key of F major.

Remember: there is a total of 15 major scales, and each major scale is associated with a unique key signature. These signatures tell you 1) the major scale that the piece uses; and 2) which sharps or flats are associated with that major scale.

[Review this lesson that introduces key signatures.](https://www.musictheory.net/lessons/24) Note that the lesson refers to a minor scale (which will be covered in Standard 3), but the concept of key signatures is the same for both major and minor scales.

### 2.33 The Circle of Fifths

The circle of fifths is an illustration that has been used in music theory pedagogy for hundreds of years. It conveniently summarizes the key signature needed for any key with up to seven flats or sharps.

But *which* notes are flat or sharp in a key? To properly use the circle of fifths to figure out a key signature, you'll need to also remember this mnemonic device, which tells you the order of flats and sharps in a key signature:

**F**ather **C**harles **G**oes **D**own **A**nd **E**nds **B**attle. 

For sharp keys (clockwise on the circle of fifths), the order of sharps will *always* be F-C-G-D-A-E-B. You can arrive at this order by reading the mnemonic device forwards. For example, if there are three sharps in a key signature (as in the key of A major), the three sharps will *always* be the first three sharps in this pattern: F-sharp, C-sharp, and G-sharp (i.e. **F**ather, **C**harles, and **G**oes). 

For flat keys (counter-clockwise on the circle of fifths), the order of flats will *always* be B-E-A-D-G-C-F. You can arrive at this order by reading the mnemonic device backwards. For example, if there are four flats in a key signature (as in the key of A-flat major), the four flats will *always* be the first four flats in this pattern when read backwards: B-flat, E-flat, A-flat, D-flat (i.e. **B**attle, **E**nds, **A**nd, **D**own). 

### 2.34 Writing key signatures ###

When you need to write a key signature for a given key, remember the following:

1. Identify the major scale (or key) that you are trying to find the key signature for.
2. If it's a scale that uses **sharps**, find the note that's a half-step below the key. This will be the final sharp in the key signature. Write all the sharps in order (F-C-G-D-A-E-B) until you reach the final sharp.
3. If it's a scale that uses **flats**, the key will be the second-to-last flat in the key signature. To find the key signature, write all the flats in order until you reach the key, and then add one more flat according to the pattern (B-E-A-D-G-C-F).

Finally, remember the sharps and flats on a key signature need to be placed on a specific line or space. For example, the "F-sharp" in a sharp key signature in treble clef will *always* be placed on the fifth line. Below is a reference that shows how all of the key signatures should be written on treble and bass clefs.

The most important thing is to keep practicing writing and identifying key signatures. With consistent practice, you will improve your speed and accuracy with writing major scales and key signatures.
