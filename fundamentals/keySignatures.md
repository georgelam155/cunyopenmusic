## 2.3 Key Signatures

### 2.31 What is a key signature?

When you're writing a piece of music that uses a specific **major scale** for an extended period of time, it gets tedious to write out the same accidentals over and over again. 

For example, here is a simple melody in D major, written without a key signature.

To avoid adding so many accidentals to the notation, composers use a **key signature** at the beginning of each staff to remind performers to always use flats or sharps for certain pitches in the major scale.

In this case, since this piece is written using the D major scale (e.g. it's in the "key" of D major), *all* F's and C's will always be played as F#'s and C#'s. Hence, instead of writing a # next to all F's and C's, we can use a key signature at the beginning of the staff to remind the performer that F and C will always be played as F-sharp and C-sharp, regardless of octave.

### 2.32 Reading Key Signatures

What do key signatures look like? Here is an example of seven different key signatures, all using sharps, and all on the treble clef.

When you see a key signature in notated music, it will always be placed at the beginning of each line of staff (also known as a "system"). The key signature is always placed directly to the left of the clef.

Here is an easy way to identify the major key of a piece of music by just looking at the key signature:

* For **sharp** key signatures, take a look at the final sharp in the signature. When you raise the pitch one half-step above the pitch indicated by the final sharp, you will arrive at the major key associated by this signature.

* For **flat** key signtures, take a look at the second-to-last flat in the signature, which indicates the major key associated with this signature. If there is only one flat, it is the key of F major.

Remember: there are 15 major keys in music, and each key is associated with a unique key signature. These signatures tell you 1) the major key that the piece uses; and 2) which sharps or flats are associated with that key.



### 2.33 The Circle of Fifths

The circle of fifths is an illustration that has been used in music theory pedagogy for hundreds of years. It conveniently summarizes the key signature needed for any key with up to seven flats or sharps.

But *which* notes are flat or sharp in a key? To properly use the circle of fifths to figure out a key signature, you'll need to also remember this mnemonic device, which tells you the order of flats and sharps:

**F**ather **C**harles **G**oes **D**own **A**nd **E**nds **B**attle. 

For sharp keys (clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic device forward. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that there are 3 sharps in the key of A major. Which three notes are sharp? The first three notes in the mnemonic device: F(ather), C(harles), and G(oes). 

For flat keys (counter-clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic device backwards. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that the key of A-flat major has four flats. Which flats? Reading backwards: B(attle), E(nds), A(nd), D(own). 

### 2.33 Writing key signatures ###

When you need to write a key signature for a given key, remember the following:

Below is a reference that shows how all of the key signatures should be written on treble, alto, tenor, and bass clefs.
