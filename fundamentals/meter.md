## 1.3 Meter

### 1.31 Types of Meter

Meter describes the way multiple pulse layers work together to organize music in time. Standard meters in Western music can be classified with two designation types:
* Simple or Compound
* Duple, Triple, or Quadruple

**Simple and Compound** classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *faster* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *division*: does each beat divide into two equal parts, or three equal parts? Meters that divide the beat into two equal parts are called *simple meters*; meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are called *compound meters*.



**Duple, Triple, and Quadruple** classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *slower* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *grouping*: how many counting pulses (or "beats") are grouped into each bar? If counting-pulse beats group into twos, we have *duple meter*; groups of three, *triple meter*; groups of four, *quadruple meter*. Conducting patterns are determined based on these classifications.

Here is an example of a song in Triple meter. Notice how the counting pulses are organized into groups of threes. In other words, you can count "ONE two three ONE two three ..." along with the song, where "ONE" is the beginning of each group. Each group is called a *bar* or *measure*.

Here is an example of a song in Quadruple meter. Similar to the above song in Triple meter, notice how the counting pulses are now organized into groups of fours. When you play the example, count aloud by saying "ONE two three four" along with the song, where "ONE" is the beginning of each bar.

Thus, we can combine these two designation types to form six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, each beat divides into two equal parts)
- simple triple (beats group into three, each beat divides into two equal parts)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, each beat divides into two equal parts)
- compound duple (beats group into two, each beat divides into two equal parts)
- compound triple (beats group into three, each beat divides into two equal parts)
- compound quadruple (beats group into four, each beat divides into two equal parts)


### 1.32 Time Signatures: Top Number

These types of meters are notated as a *time signature*, placed at the beginning of the music, to the right of the clef.

The *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12


### 1.33 Time Signatures: Bottom Number

The *bottom number* tells us the type of note that is used to represent the duration of one beat. This duration depends on whether the meter is *simple* or *compound*.

In *simple meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single beat*. If a simple meter is notated such that each quarter note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4. If a simple meter is notated such that each half note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 2. If a simple meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 8. And so on. 

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that because **the beat is divided into three in a compound meter**, the beat is always three times as long as the division note, and *the beat is always dotted*.

To review, for *simple meters*:
- 2: a half note equals one beat.
- 4: a quarter note equals one beat.
- 8: an eighth note equals one beat.

For *compound meters*:
- 2: a half note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted whole note equals one beat.
- 4: a quarter note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted half note equals one beat.
- 8: an eighth note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted quarter note equals one beat.
