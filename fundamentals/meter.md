## 1.3 Meter

<abbr title="Definition for Meter">Meter</abbr> describes the way multiple pulse layers work together to organize music in time. Standard meters in Western music can be classified with two designation types:
* Simple or Compound (describes how each pulse is divided)
* Duple, Triple, or Quadruple (describes how many each measure is divided into pulses)

### 1.31 Simple vs. Compound

**Simple and Compound** classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *faster* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *division*: does each pulse generally divide into two equal parts, or three equal parts? Meters that divide the pulse into two equal parts are called *simple meters*; meters that divide the pulse into three equal parts are called *compound meters*.

Here is an example of a song in simple meter. Notice that the counting pulse can be evenly divided into groups of two notes (as seen in the first three pulses of the excerpt). The beginning of each pulse is marked by an asterisk.

Here is an example of a song in compound meter. Notice how, in contrast to the above example, the counting pulse is now divided into groups of three notes each, instead of two. The beginning of each pulse is marked by an asterisk.

### 1.32 Duple, Triple and Quadruple

**Duple, Triple, and Quadruple** classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *slower* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *grouping*: how many counting pulses (or "beats") are grouped into each bar? If the counting pulse can be organized into groups of two, we have *duple meter*; groups of three, *triple meter*; groups of four, *quadruple meter*.

Here is an example of a song in Duple meter. Notice how the counting pulse are organized into groups of twos. In other words, you can count "ONE two ONE two..." along with the song, where "ONE" is the beginning of each group. Each group of pulses is called a "bar" or "measure".

Here is an example of a song in Triple meter. Notice how the counting pulses are organized into groups of threes. In other words, you can count "ONE two three ONE two three ..." along with the song, where "ONE" is the beginning of each group.

Here is an example of a song in Quadruple meter. Similar to the above song in Triple meter, notice how the counting pulses are now organized into groups of fours. When you play the example, count aloud by saying "ONE two three four" along with the song, where "ONE" is the beginning of each bar or measure. **Important**: Quadruple meter and Duple meter are very closely related, in that you can almost always hear a bar of music in Quadruple meter as two bars of Duple meter.

Thus, we can combine these two designation types to form six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (each measure consists of two pulses, each pulse divides into two equal parts)
- simple triple (each measure consists of three pulses, each pulse divides into two equal parts)
- simple quadruple (each measure consists of four pulses, each pulse divides into two equal parts)
- compound duple (each measure consists of two pulses, each pulse divides into three equal parts)
- compound triple (each measure consists of three pulses, each pulse divides into three equal parts)
- compound quadruple (each measure consists of four pulses, each pulse divides into three equal parts)


### 1.34 Time Signatures: Top Number

These types of meters are notated as a *time signature*, placed at the beginning of the music, to the right of the clef.

The *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12

A note about definitions:

- **Pulse** refers to the regular, recurring sense of stress in music. Think of the way that you would tap your foot to a song; or when you can find your regular heartbeat; that's a pulse.
- **Beat** refers to the duration of time from one pulse to the next. Let's say there is a song that goes along at a speed of 60 pulses per minute. In this case, each beat would last exactly 1 second, or 1/60 of a minute.

### 1.35 Time Signatures: Bottom Number

The *bottom number* tells us the type of note that is used to represent the duration of one beat. This duration depends on whether the meter is *simple* or *compound*.

In *simple meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single beat*. If a simple meter is notated such that each quarter note corresponds to the duration of one beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4. If a simple meter is notated such that each half note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 2. If a simple meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 8. And so on. 

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. 

If a compound meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to *a single division of the beat*, that means that each beat actually consists of *three* eighth notes, or, a dotted quarter note. Note that because **in compound meter, each pulse or beat is divided into three equal parts**, the actual beat is always three times as long as the division note that's indicated by the bottom number.


To review, for *simple meters*:
- 2: a half note equals one beat.
- 4: a quarter note equals one beat.
- 8: an eighth note equals one beat.

For *compound meters*:
- 2: a half note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted whole note equals one beat.
- 4: a quarter note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted half note equals one beat.
- 8: an eighth note equals to *one third* of a beat. Hence, a dotted quarter note equals one beat.
