## Standard 4: Intervals

### 4.1 What's an "interval"?

An *interval* is the distance between two pitches, usually measured in two components: 1) the size, and 2) the quality.

The term *interval* regularly refers both to:
1. The distance between two pitches on a scale, as described by the size and quality (e.g. major 2nd), and;
2. Two pitches that are separated by that distance (e.g. G and A).

A *melodic interval* describes the distance between two pitches that are sounded one after another (as in a *melody*). A *harmonic interval* describes the distance between two pitches that are sounded together, at the same time (as in *harmony*).

### 4.2 Interval Size

We can describe the interval between two notes first by stating its *size*, which is the number of letters that we can count from the the bottom pitch to the top pitch, **including both pitches in the count**.

For example, here are two examples of a **2nd**: both as a melodic interval and a harmonic interval

To find the size, begin with the *letter names only*. That is, treat C, C-sharp, and C-flat all as *C* for the time being. Next, count the number of steps (different letters) between the two pitches in question, *including both pitches in your count*. Start from the bottom pitch and count up the musical alphabet to the top pitch. Remember, you must include both pitches of the interval in your count!

Here's an example of a **4th**. The letters are C-D-E-F. We are igoring the F# here when we count the size of this interval.

### 4.3 Interval Quality

Often more specificity is needed than what the interval size can provide. That specificity comes in the form of an interval's *quality*. Combining the *size* and *quality* gives us the full description of that interval.

There are five possible interval qualities:

- augmented (A)
- major (M)
- perfect (P)
- minor (m)
- diminished (d)

Let's start with talking about the diatonic intervals, which are Major and Perfect.

### 4.4 Diatonic Intervals

The term "diatonic interval" describes the interval between two notes, where the top pitch is part of the major scale built on the bottom pitch. For example, here are eight different harmonic intervals all built on the C major scale, with C as the bottom note:

The names of the intervals above are as follows, from left to right:

- Perfect Unison (P1)
- Major 2nd (M2)
- Major 3rd (M3)
- Perfect 4th (P4)
- Perfect 5th (P5)
- Major 6th (M6)
- Major 7th (M7)
- Perfect Octave (P8)
