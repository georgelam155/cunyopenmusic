## The Scale

A *scale* is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. There are two types of steps: *half steps* and *whole steps*. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps.  

## The Chromatic Scale ##

The chromatic scale consists entirely of half steps, and uses every pitch on the keyboard within a single octave. Here is the chromatic scale that spans the pitches C4 through C5.

## The Major Scale ##

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of a pattern of whole steps and half steps in a given pattern:

**W - W - H** - W - **W - W - H**

Notice that 1) there are seven steps in the above pattern, and 2) the pattern consists of two "W - W - H" patterns connected together with an extra "W" in the middle. This smaller pattern of "W - W - H" is called a **Tetrachord**. By connecting two tetrachords together with an additional whole step, we can form the pattern for the **Major Scale**. 

The first pitch of the scale, called the *tonic*, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated at the end an octave higher and thus completes the scale.

Here is the D major scale. It is called the "D major scale" because the pitch D is the *tonic* and is heard at both ends of the scale.

## Scale degrees and solfège ##

While ISO notation (e.g. C4, D4) allows us to label a pitch in its specific register, it is often useful to know where that pitch fits within a given scale. For example, the pitch D is the first (and last) note of the D-major scale. The pitch A is the fifth note of the D-major scale. When described in this way, we call the notes **scale degrees**, because they're placed in context of a specific scale.

**Solfège syllables**, [a centuries-old method of teaching pitch and sight singing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfège), can also be used to represent scale degrees (when used in this way, this system is specifically called movable-*do* solfège). 

Scale degrees are labeled with Arabic numerals and carets (^). The illustration below shows a D-major scale and corresponding ISO notation, scale degrees, and solfège syllables.
