## Standard 6: Seventh Chords ##	

### 6.1 What is a "seventh chord"?

We conclude our study of the fundamentals of music theory with one more type of chord - one that includes four notes sounded together.

A **Seventh Chords** is a four-note chord whose pitches can be arranged as thirds. Like with a triad, the pitches belonging to a seventh chord occupy adjacent positions (a four-pitch-class clump) on the circle of thirds.

Also like a triad, we attribute names to each member of the chord. The four members of a seventh chord are named as: the *root*, *third*, *fifth*, and *seventh*.

### 6.2 Types of Seventh Chords

There are five qualities of seventh chords that appear in diatonic music: major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, diminished seventh (also called fully-diminished), and half-diminished seventh. They are comprised of the following intervals above their roots:	

- major seventh: M3, P5, and M7 above the root (or major triad with a major seventh)	
- dominant seventh: M3, P5, and m7 above the root (or major triad with a minor seventh)	
- minor seventh: m3, P5, and m7 above the root (or minor triad with a minor seventh)	
- diminished seventh: m3, d5, and d7 above the root (or diminished triad with a diminished seventh)	
- half-diminished seventh: m3, d5, and m7 above the root (or diminished triad with a minor seventh)
