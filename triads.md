## Standard 5: Triads

### 5.1 Chords and Triads

Now that we are familiar with the basic building blocks of melodic writing, let's take a look at harmony. First, a few definitions:

- A **chord** is any combination of three or more pitches that sound simultaneously.

- A **triad** is a three-note chord whose pitches can be arranged in a series of thirds.

<!--To tell whether or not a chord is a triad, take the pitch classes present in the chord. Assuming there are three pitch classes (not necessarily three *pitches*), arrange them on the circle of generic scale steps. (By generic, I mean that A-natural, A-flat, and A-sharp are all kinds of A.)-->

To quickly determine whether a three-note chord is a triad, arrange the three notes on the "circle of thirds" below. The pitch classes of a triad will always sit next to each other.

### 5.2 Identifying and labeling triads

Triads are identified according to their *root* and *quality*.

#### 5.21 Triad roots

To find a triad’s root, arrange the pitch classes on a circle of thirds (mentally or on paper). The root is the *lowest* in the three-pitch clump. Expressed another way, if the circle *ascends* by thirds as it moves clockwise, the root is the “earliest” note (thinking like a literal clock), and the other pitch classes come “later.”

Once you know the root, you can identify the remaining notes as the *third* of the chord (a third above the root) and the *fifth* of the chord (a fifth above the root).

#### 5.22 Triad qualities

To find a triad’s quality, identify the *interval* between the root and the other members of the chord. There are four qualities of triads that appear in major and minor scales, each with their own characteristic intervals.

-   major triad: M3 and P5 above the root (as in *do–mi–sol*)
-   minor triad: m3 and P5 above the root (as in *do–me–sol* or *la–do–mi*)
-   diminished triad: m3 and d5 above the root (as in *ti–re–fa*)
-   augmented triad: M3 and A5 above the root (as in *me–sol–ti*)

### 5.3 Lead-sheet symbols

A triad can be summed up by a single symbol, such as a lead-sheet chord symbol. A lead sheet symbol includes information about both root quality, as well as which pitch class occurs in the lowest voice (called the *bass* regardless of who is singing or playing that pitch).

A lead-sheet symbol begins with a capital letter (and, if necessary, an accidental) denoting the root of the chord. That letter is followed by information about a chord’s quality:

-   major triad: no quality symbol is added
-   minor triad: lower-case “m”
-   diminished triad: lower-case “dim” or a degree sign “°”
-   augmented triad: lower-case “aug” or a plus sign “+”

Finally, if a pitch other than the chord root is the lowest note in the chord, a slash is added, followed by a capital letter denoting the pitch class in the bass (lowest) voice.

A C-major triad’s lead-sheet symbol is simply **C**. A C-minor triad is **Cm**. A D-sharp-diminished triad with an F-sharp in the bass is **D\#dim/F\#**. And so on.

### 5.4 Building a triad

To build a triad on the staff, identify the root, quality, and bass note for the triad. The root and quality will tell you what three pitches belong to the triad. For example, **C<sup>+</sup>** tells you the root is C, and the quality is augmented. Since the quality is augmented, there is a major third above the root (E) and an augmented fifth above the root (G-sharp).

Next, write a C on the staff (in any comfortable register), then write the other chord tones (E and G-sharp) *above* the C (see the Caug triad in the above figure).

### 5.5 Listening to triads

Each triad quality has its own distinct sound, and to an extent that sound is preserved even when the chord is *inverted* (when the pitches are arranged so that a pitch other than the root is in the lowest voice). As you practice identifying and writing triads, be sure to play the triads, both to check your analysis/writing and to develop the ability to identify chord qualities quickly by ear.
